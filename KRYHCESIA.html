	<p>I'm findin' ways to articulate The feeling I'm goin' through I just can't say I don't love you 'Cause I love you, yeah It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold But tonight I'm gon' let you know Let me tell the truth Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
	You know what I'm thinkin' See it in your eyes You hate that you want me Hate it when you cry You're scared to be lonely 'Specially in the night I'm scared that I'll miss you Happens every time I don't want this feelin' I can't afford love I try to find reason to pull us apart
	It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect And I know that you're worth it I can't walk away, oh! Even though we're going through it And it makes you feel alone Just know that I would die for you Baby I would die for you, yeah The distance and the time between us It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
	I would die for you Baby I would die for you, yeah I'm finding ways to manipulate the feelin' you're goin' through But baby girl, I'm not blamin' you Just don't blame me too, yeah 'Cause I can't take this pain forever And you won't find no one that's better 'Cause I'm right for you, babe
	I think I'm right for you, babe You know what I'm thinkin' See it in your eyes You hate that you want me Hate it when you cry It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect And I know that you're worth it I can't walk away, oh! Even though we're going through it And it makes you feel alone
	Just know that I would die for you Baby I would die for you, yeah The distance and the time between us It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby I would die for you Baby I would die for you, yeah I would die for you I would lie for you Keep it real with you I would kill for you, my baby
	I'm just sayin', yeah I would die for you I would lie for you Keep it real with you I would kill for you, my baby Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na Even though we're going through it And it makes you feel alone Just know that I would die for you Baby I would die for you, yeah
	The distance and the time between us It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby I would die for you Baby I would die for you, yeah babe (Die for you)
