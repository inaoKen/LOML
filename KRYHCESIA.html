Never wanna be separated
I'm captivated
Everyone says you're complicated
Every day, you're my most awaited, oh
I'm captivated
Oh, they don't see you as I do
You are so beautiful
Come breathe within my soul
Let go
Oh, my love
You don't have to listen to a word they say
'Cause all that really matters is that I love you
I really do
Oh, I need you and I really hate it
But I'll never get tired of waiting
I'm captivated
Oh, they don't see you as I do
You are so beautiful
Come breathe within my soul
Let go
Oh, my love
You don't have to listen to a word they say
'Cause all that really matters is that I love you
I really do
Oh, my love
You don't have to listen to a word they say
'Cause all that really matters is that I love you
I really do
Na s'ya ay muling kasama, kausap, kapiling
Kailangang tanggapin na wala na s'ya sa akin
Ngunit heto ang mga pabilin
Yakapin mo s'yang mahigpit 'pag s'ya ay galit
Manatili sa kanyang tabi
Hawakan ang kanyang mukha, tignan sa mata
Ipaalalang kakampi ka n'ya
Sana'y gawin ang lahat ng 'di ko nagawa
'Wag ibalewala ang mga oras
Na s'ya'y masungit at ulo'y mainit
'Pag kailangan ka n'ya, 'wag kang mag-antala
S'ya'y amuhin at 'yong pakainin
Yakapin mo s'yang mahigpit 'pag s'ya ay galit
Manatili sa kanyang tabi
Hawakan ang kanyang mukha, tignan sa mata
Ipaalalang kakampi ka n'ya
Sana'y gawin ang lahat ng 'di ko nagawa
Sana'y 'wag magpahuli
Bilang lamang ang sandali
'Di man natin gustuhin
Ang oras ay 'di sa 'tin
Yakapin mo s'yang mahigpit sa bawat sandali
Na parang 'yon na ang huli
Sabihin ang nadarama na mahal mo rin s'ya
Huwag nang hintaying mawala
Lagi mo s'yang pakinggan at lagi mong kakantahan
Sana'y gawin ang lahat ng 'di ko nagawa.
Di ko alam
San sisimulan
Kapag ba binitawan
Makakalimutan?
Sana naman
Napagbigyan
Ng kahit konting oras
Para magpaalam
Sana maintindihan
Di ko pa yata kayang
Hindi ka na makita
Pag gising sa umaga
Ikaw, kaw lang naman ang hanap
Kaw lang ang pinangarap noon
Paano na ngayon
Paano tanggaping wala ka na
Paano at saan Magsisimula?
Kung nasan ka man
Sana mapakinggan
Ang aking panalangin
Na ika'y mahagkan
Ng kahit saglit
Ng ilang sandali
O san kukuha ng lakas
Kung ikaw ang dahilan
Di ko maintindihan
Di ko pa yata kayang
Hindi ka na makita
Pag gising sa umaga
Ikaw, kaw lang naman ang hanap
Kaw lang ang pinangarap noon
Paano na ngayon
Paano tanggaping wala ka na
Paano at saan Magsisimula?
Kahit di pa yata kayang
Hindi ka na makita
Babangon sa umaga
Hindi ko pa man makita
Mahahanap rin ang kalma
Tulad nung nandito ka pa
Hindi na pipigilan ang luha
Sa bawat oras na maisip ka
Hindi mawawalan ng pagasa
Sa pagitan ng wakas, at ng simula
My life was incomplete earlier than you got here into it. Since I met you, my life has been modified completely. You’re like a flower that has many fragrances in it. Thanks for decorating my life with the colours of your love. I love you!
